    proposalStatus: Accepted
    sections: 
      - section: Runtime
        summary: Adjusting the error message for allocation errors and checking the freezing threshold on memory grow and canister allocation changes
      - section: Node
        summary: Updating IC join notification message, directing setupOS error messages to a matrix channel, fixing a bug preventing config partition population, and adding checks for the freezing threshold on memory allocation and canister allocation changes
      - section: Networking
        summary: Improving state sync manager metrics, supporting uni streams in quic transport, allowing state sync manager chunk timeouts, and increasing bitcoin adapter default timeout to 50 ms
      - section: Message Routing
        summary: Not incrementing critical error counter in message routing for "registry not available yet" error
      - section: Crypto
        summary: Adding initial vetKD utils package, returning errors instead of panicking in load_threshold_signing_key_internal, limiting the number of paths and labels for read state requests, and improving performance using mul2 in naive multi-exponentiation in BLS12_381
      - section: Consensus
        summary: Canister Http Bytes Migration, cleaning up old ECDSA backward compatibility patching, combining signature and version checks during validation, not relaying consensus and certification shares, and adding a metric counting failed upgrade checks while fixing orchestrator termination and manageboot.sh handling
